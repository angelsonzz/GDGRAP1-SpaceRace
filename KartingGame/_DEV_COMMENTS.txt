- I am trying to implement the textures into the FPS mode
- Right now, it is still buggy. It does not completely render the whole model (Because you didnt enable glEnable(GL_DEPTH_TEST) and | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT)

- forgot to add here xd
- basically wot i said in gc, idk y kart is using camera movement stuff when we could use translation in model
- I made kart child of model, but camera is not following the player anymore and its 
also running more smoothly. 
- the above mentioned is not in the main code. I just put it in original code cuz idk if u want that or just retain the old code
